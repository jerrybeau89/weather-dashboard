# Weather-Dashboard
This repo features an app that hosts a 5 day weather forecast on any location you select.

## Description

From heading to work or heading to visit friends and family, everyone goes outside at some point. When we do the weather can be a huge deciding factor of how we dress. Therefore, knowing the weather in advance can allow us to prepare for what's ahead. I created this project as a way to help others know what the weather will be like so they can plan accordingly. Users will be abe to input a city of their choosing and the app will use an api to call data on the weather of that city. Users will also be able to view past cities they have searched through clickable history links dynamically added to the page. They will see both current weather and a 5 day weather forecast. In creating this project, I had a difficult time parsing through the data. However, that allowed me to deepen my understanding of how to read and call data from API's.
